Rio de Janeiro - Custom Scenery for FlightGear
==============================================

Scenery originally created by statto. Scenery objects from default TerraMaster.

In 2011, the user statto had released an amazing custom scenery for Rio de Janeiro on his website (http://stattosoftware.com/flightgear/), with much better landclasses than the default one. Over the years though the default scenery of Rio de Janeiro (from TerraMaster) received several nice objects, such as the statue of Christ the Redeemer, very detailed airport biuldings to SBRJ, some cones for air races somewhere close to Flamengo, among others etc. I incorporated those objects into his scenery and also tried my best to move the statue of christ to a decent position (which is quite tricky because of how pointy is the mountain in this scenery). 

Statto has kindly allowed me to redistribute his scenery together with the default objects as to make it easier for people to install it, so for that I created this repository.
